Thank you for considering contributing to this project! To make collaboration easy and productive, please follow the guidelines below.

How to file issues
- Search existing issues to see if the problem or idea has already been reported.
- When opening a new issue, provide a clear and descriptive title and a detailed description including:
  - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details (OS, shell, versions)
  - Any relevant logs or error messages
- Use labels where appropriate (bug, enhancement, question).

How to open pull requests (PRs)
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch (use a descriptive name, e.g., feature/add-tests or fix/typo-in-readme).
- Make small, focused commits with clear commit messages.
- Run existing tests (if any) and add tests for new functionality or bug fixes.
- Push your branch to your fork and open a PR against the main branch of this repository.
- In your PR description, include a summary of changes, why they are needed, and link any related issues (use "Fixes #<issue>" to auto-close).
- Be prepared to respond to review comments and iterate on your changes.

Coding style
- Follow language-appropriate best practices. For shell scripts, strive for POSIX-compatible sh where feasible.
- Keep code readable and well-commented.
- Prefer small, single-purpose functions and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Use tools such as shellcheck for shell scripts and linters for other languages when available.

Tests
- Add or update tests to cover important behavior for new features and bug fixes.
- Describe how to run tests in your PR if they are not run automatically.

Commit message style
- Use clear, imperative-style commit messages, e.g., "Fix typo in README" or "Add simple-interest script".
- Include a short summary on the first line and additional details in the body if necessary.
- If the commit addresses an issue, reference it in the message (e.g., "Fixes #12").

Code of Conduct and license
- Please follow the project's Code of Conduct: see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for expectations and reporting instructions.
- By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under this repository's license (see LICENSE). If the repository does not contain a LICENSE file, contact the maintainers before submitting a contribution.
