# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy toward other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, at their discretion.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they determine to be unacceptable, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. This Code of Conduct also applies to all interactions that involve the project or its community, including interactions on mailing lists, issue trackers, code review systems, chat channels, and in-person events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at qurbaneliii+code-of-conduct@users.noreply.github.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

When responding to a report, maintainers will take steps they deem appropriate, which may include an initial private conversation with the reporter to gather more information, confirming and documenting the facts, and if necessary, taking disciplinary action ranging from a warning to temporary or permanent ban from the project and its community.

Maintainers are obligated to protect the privacy of reporters and will handle reports with discretion to the extent possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The following are example enforcement steps that may be taken at the maintainers' discretion, depending on the severity and frequency of the offense:

1. Informal resolution: a private message or conversation to explain the issue and request a change in behavior.
2. Formal warning: a clear written warning explaining the behavior, expectations, and consequences for further violations.
3. Temporary suspension: temporary loss of contributing privileges or access to project resources.
4. Permanent ban: removal of access to the project and resources and prohibition from future participation.

The maintainers may choose an appropriate combination of these steps depending on circumstances. The goal of enforcement is to correct behavior and preserve a safe and welcoming community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org. We thank the authors and maintainers of that template for providing a well-considered baseline for community behavior.
